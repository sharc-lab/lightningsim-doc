For this portion of the tutorial, we will be using the Synestia VMs to run AMD/Xilinx tools and LightningSim. Under the “Synth & Emu” tab, within the “Desktops” section, click “Synestia Desktop”:

You will be given the option to choose settings for your requested VM instance. Leave the defaults and launch the instance. After a few seconds, you should have a running session:
