Ex. 4: A More Complex Design
============================

LightningSim truly shines when it comes to larger, more complex designs that take minutes or hours to synthesize and simulate. As an example, we will use one of the graph neural network (GNN) accelerator designs from `FlowGNN <https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13103>`_.
