This part of the tutorial is dedicated to ‚ö°LightningSim, an ultra-fast and accurate trace-based simulator for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) designs. We will walk through the process of installing and running LightningSim for several example Vitis HLS projects and comparing their results with C/RTL cosimulation.

If you are interested in the second half of the tutorial about RealProbeüîç, a fully automated on-board profiling tool to measure real on-FPGA performance with ease, please visit the `RealProbe tutorial <https://realprobe-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/tutorial.html>`_.
