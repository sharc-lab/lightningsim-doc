In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of installing and running LightningSim for several small example Vitis HLS projects and comparing their results with C/RTL co-simulation.

**If you are attending this tutorial in-person at FCCM 2024:** We will be using resources graciously provided by Dr. Jeff Young at the `Center for Research into Novel Compute Hierarchies <https://crnch.gatech.edu/>`_ at Georgia Tech. Continue to :doc:`login to the system <setup-crnch>`.

**If you are following this tutorial remotely:** You will need access to a machine meeting the `LightningSim system requirements <https://github.com/sharc-lab/LightningSim/blob/v0.2.0/README.md#system-requirements>`_. Proceed to :doc:`setup your local environment <setup-local>`.
