Welcome
=======

**Welcome to the LightningSim tutorial!** LightningSim is an ultra-fast and accurate trace-based simulator for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) designs. We will walk through the process of installing and running LightningSim for several example Vitis HLS projects and comparing their results with C/RTL cosimulation.
